We cloned the 3.\+8 version of fio from \href{https://github.com/axboe/fio/tree/ac694f66968fe7b18c820468abd8333f3df333fb}{\texttt{ its github repository}} and modified it to use libnvmmio. As shown in the \href{fio-libnvmmio.patch}{\texttt{ fio-\/libnvmmio.\+patch}} file, we only modified 8 lines. After building fio, you can run fio using the \href{run.sh}{\texttt{ run.\+sh}} script.
